description: Learn how to force a specific color mode on a page

You can force the color mode at the page level by setting the `colorMode` property using `definePageMeta`:

```html [pages/light.vue]
<template>
  <h1>This page is forced with light mode</h1>
</template>

<script setup>
definePageMeta({
  colorMode: 'light',
})
</script>
```

This feature is perfect for implementing dark mode to a website incrementally by setting the not-ready pages to `colorMode: 'light'`.

We recommend to hide or disable the color mode picker on the page since it won't be able to change the current page color mode, using `$colorMode.forced` value.
